## LoopLine

Two players, one 4x4 grid, and a whole lot of marble chaos! In this game, you’ll take turns placing your marbles on the board, but with a twist, every time you finish a turn, all the marbles spin counterclockwise! It’s like playing connect 4 but with marbles that never sit still (and it is a little irritating to be honest).

The goal is simple: be the first to line up four of your marbles in a row horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. Each playe has 15 seconds to play their turn or the marbles will move counterclockwise giving your opponent and advantage.

Strategize, anticipate the spin, and try not to let your opponent get one step ahead. It’s a game of quick thinking, surprising twists, and plenty of fun.
